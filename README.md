The page has two buttons in the upper right-hand corner: a save button, and a '+' button. The save button will appear once a note is completely filled in with title and note content. Saved notes will appear on the left-hand side of the screen. Notes can also be deleted by clicking on the red garbage icon that is on the right end of each note in the list on the left-hand side.

This application uses ExpressJS, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As mentioned above, it was deployed through heroku.
